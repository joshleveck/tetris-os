# TETRIS OS
## A Tetris Operating System for the Raspberry Pi 3
This is a Tetris game that runs bare metal on a Raspberry Pi 3 Emulator (QEMU). It is written in C and ARM Assembly. It is a simple operating system that can run Tetris and nothing else. It is a fun project to learn about operating systems and how they work.

### Disclaimer
I understand this is not an "OS". It is a program that runs on bare metal. However, calling it Tetris OS is a lot more fun than calling it a "bare metal implementation of the classic Tetris game".
